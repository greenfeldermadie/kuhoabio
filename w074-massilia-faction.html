                            <p>The Greeks formed their colony at Massilia around 600 BCE. Coming from Phocaea, they intended to harvest the region's resources, and conduct trade from Massilia's natural harbour. Massilia Faction : The Greeks formed their colony at Massilia around 600BC. Coming from Phocaea, they intended to harvest the region's resources and trade from Massilia's natural harbour. By the beginning of the 4th century BC, the former trading post had sprouted into one of the busiest. Massilia has a nice mix of mid-tier Hellenic and low-tier Celtic units. The range ut units they can bring makes them versatile, but not dominant in either. Today we look at the Massilians and their roster. Enjoy. Due to its geographical position and resource-rich surroundings, there have been settlements around Massilia for thousands of years. The Greeks occupied it for precisely the same reasons, forming their first colony on the Gallic coast there around 600BC.

Why is it so difficult to get trade agreements with people? One the first game you could easily get them with anyone you weren't at war with, but I've played 3 or 4 games, for about 2 or 3 hours each and only managed to get 1 trade agreement, is there a different way to go about it? Any advice would be much appreciated.  I have played many campaigns in Rome 2, but I can not get past turn 20 or so with Massilia. It is unbelievable. I really want to survive and be the one greek faction in the middle of all these tribes, but they gang up on me every single time and it is impossible to defend against all of them. Turn 1-5 I usually try to build up and pay off all of my neighbors save Volcae. I try to take him out. Turn 5-10 either Insubres or Ligeria takes over the city below/above them and decide to declare. - Baktria Faction - Beasts of War - Hannibal at the Gates - Pirates & Raiders - Daughters of Mars - Black Sea Colonies Culture Pack - Augustus Campaign Pack - Wrath of Sparta DLC - Massilia Faction - Empire Divided - Desert Kingdoms Culture Pack - Rise of the Republic Campaign. So im kinda a total war player that likes to play the "civilized" factions but i think i have exhausted my option in those. I've played: Egypt, Rome, Bactria, Cimmeria, Carthage, Sparta, Pergamon, Pompey (augustus campaign). I own all the DLC's and im open to idea's of campaigns within like Ceasar in Gaul, just haven't played those DLC's much yet. What would you recommend. 
I was going to do the Divide et Impera version of this campaign, but it looks like that one is still far from finished (Iolei is basically a Gallic faction.wut), so I just tried loading up a vanilla on Very Hard. Everything's going nice. I have to manage my PO a bit so it's not just pure expansion cheese. The problem is, I just noticed that at turn 67 Taras already controls 18 settlements all the way up to Samnium. It just seems strange. Is Hard better at preventing other factions from expandi. Creative Assembly may be spooling up for Total War Attila's release date but they're still releasing new factions for Rome 2. Better still, they're giving away one of those factions for free.On 20 November everyone who owns Rome 2 will find themselves able to play with the new Greek. Playing on normal. I already heard how slow the mod is but It's slowed to a crawl for me. Here's my situation: I'm playing as the Nobiles, took Sicily (allied Syracuse) Northern Italy, Massilia to Tolosa down Iberia to Arse and Ibossim in about 100 turns. Carthage declares war on me in the middle of fighting Massilia in Iberia, lose an entire legion to the bastards in a 3v1 battle. I took Carthage proper and North Africa down to Lpqy. This entire time I'm bogged down in revolt after revolt. We use cookies and other technology that recognise you to improve your online experience.

Most recently I am playing a divide et impera campaign as Epirus and I am not enthralled to be coming to blows against Massilia, the faction I carried to victory in my first campaign. Массилия тысячелетиями привлекала людей своим географическим положением и природными богатствами. A new day had descended on the wonderful city of Toledo, where there were few clouds in the sky, and the ones that were in the sky were only seen sparingly, rather than clustered together. The white puffs didn’t threatened rain, and in fact served to provide cover of the winter sun that hung above the land. Birds chirped, and small mammals from the grasslands made themselves at home without much human intervention. The tranquil setting contrasted just a bit with how the Toledo Conference - Massilia Faction - Empire Divided - Desert Kingdoms Culture Pack Системные требования: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 Процессор: Intel Dual Core с тактовой частотой. Hi all, amp#x200B; What is your favourite strategy for the Scipii?

In 247 BCE, the Carthaginian king (in this alternate reality, Carthage never became a republic) died, and the kingdom was taken over by his son Theophanes, who had spent the last 25 years serving in the military, and had risen to become the general of the entire army. A keen tactical mind enabled him to easily expand Carthaginian territory westward, placing all of northwest Africa under Carthaginian rule. Desire for more spurred him across the Straight of Gibraltar in 243 BCE, and he began.

The reason being that it starts of in a do or die situation, but it has great and diverse units and massive potential after the initial hump. Let me outline the massive potential of epirus: Epirus units. They have the very fun standard Greek loadout with hoplites, pikemen, great skirmishers. The thing that I like about their unit selection is their better cavalry. I don't like to be stuck with citizen cav for melee.

Does anyone else, when they get really powerful, start supporting another faction to rise up and be powerful too? Currently playing as the Avernii and got quite lucky with diplomatic treaties; meaning once I defeated Rome with the help if Carthage I had no real challenge. Instead of just giving up like I normally would I decided to help Macedonia and carthage build large empires. I regularly donate them money and have been trying to push them into wars to expand their lands. At the moment. Minor Faction 51TH Massilia Corporation in Elite: Dangerous. 
Recentely i have started playing Rome 2 again with Massilia. The starting position of Massilia creates some fun possibilities. Do you invade Italy or do you conquer your Barbarian neighbours. I also really like the mix of Greek and Barbarian units this faction has. It grants the possibibility for some interesting army compositions. These are a few of the reasons why Massilia is my favorite faction. I was wondering what everybody's favorite faction I am playing a Gran Campaign as the Nervii. Expanded southward to counter Massilia and now own most Gaul, Germania, all Italy and northern Iberia. My diplomatic relations have been very good with many factions. As I was taking Italy from the Romans I figured my next target was Syracuse since they hated my guts because of my good relation with Carthage and my military actions against Rome (tough titties Syracuse, it was them who declared war on me. Anyway.) However they were pretty strong.

Hello, started to play the game again and I noticed I have a game saved playing as Massilia from 2015. But I can't find the faction when I try to pay a new grand campaing, I never bought any DLC so I guess it was something free, was it temporal or am I going crazy. Wish they would give us Massila as the next free faction, destroying barbarians with greek soldiers right in the heart I really love the DeI mod and I think it makes Rome 2 the best playing experience atm besides FoS out of all total war Titels. I still struggeling in most of the campaigns on hard or very hard though. My fav factions so far are Epirus (Just for the challenge and the interresting way the world goes if there is no Rome), Massilia for their easy way to get friends all around the world and expanding into 3 different directions (I play them atm and I first got into Iberia down till I bordered Carth.

So I got Rome2 a while ago mostly to play head to head with a friend. I haven't played any tw since i was playing medieval2. I started with a hard campaign with Massilia to check the game and then i started playing head to head with my friend. After 4-5 matches we got bored of the possible picks (we played massilia vs iberian, pontus vs pergamon, armenia vs cimmeria, epirus vs getae). Just getting the capital as winning condition kind of ruins the whole game. Then i played a hard getae campai. Total War: ROME II - Massilia Faction Total War: ROME II - Empire Divided.
